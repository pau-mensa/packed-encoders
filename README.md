    A padding-free runtime for Encoders
</div>

&nbsp;

## ⭐️ Overview

`packed-encoders` is a high-performance execution engine for **ModernBERT** backbones. One call — `pe.pack(model)` — monkeypatches a live Hugging Face `ModernBertModel` **in place** with fused CuteDSL LayerNorm, RoPE, and GeGLU kernels, cuBLAS GEMMs, packed (padding-free) attention with per-GPU calibrated dispatch, and optional CUDA graphs.

The kernels consume Hugging Face's exact weight layout, so nothing is re-packed and no wrapper class exists. `state_dict`, `save_pretrained`, `from_pretrained`, and gradient checkpointing all remain HF's own (or any other wrappers on top of HF). `pe.unpack(model)` restores the stock forward.

**Inference**: **1.9–2.1x** document encoding and **2.5–2.6x** query encoding vs eager Hugging Face on an RTX 5090 (**1.3–1.5x** vs `torch.compile` max-autotune), at cosine ≥ 0.999 output parity.

**Indexing**: **2.9–3.3x** documents/second on a real long-document corpus, with **~26% less** peak reserved VRAM.

**Training**: **7.0x** median GradCache step time on a B200 running the Agent-ModernColBERT recipe — **4.6x** wall-clock even after paying all compile warmup — with **~37% less** per-step reserved memory and a bit-identical initial loss.

Check the [benchmark section](#benchmarks) for the full tables.

> [!NOTE]  
> ModernBERT backbones at `hidden_size` divisible by 256 are supported, this includes the obvious [ModernBERT](https://huggingface.co/answerdotai/ModernBERT-base) but also: any encoder trained with the same architecture (such as [Ettin](https://huggingface.co/jhu-clsp/ettin-encoder-1b) or [mmBERT](https://huggingface.co/jhu-clsp/mmBERT-base)), late-interaction encoders trained with ModernBERT as the base (such as [ModernColBERT](https://huggingface.co/lightonai/GTE-ModernColBERT-v1)) and any finetunes that sit on top of those. The package offers a `validate()` function to check compatibility.

&nbsp;

## Why packing?

Encoder runtimes were never meant to be rectangular, we're just inheriting decoder tooling and living with that. Queries are ~30 tokens, documents are hundreds to thousands, and contrastive batches mix both. Padding every sequence to the batch maximum spends real FLOPs, memory, and attention work on tokens that don't exist.

packed-encoders removes that waste in three layers, each usable independently:

1. **Fused tail** — CuteDSL LayerNorm / residual-LayerNorm / RoPE / GeGLU kernels plus cuBLAS GEMMs replace the stock layer internals. The kernels are shape-agnostic (the token count is a runtime grid dimension), so one compiled artifact serves every batch shape with no recompiles.
2. **Packed execution** — the padded `[B, S]` forward internally unpads to a flat `[total_tokens]` buffer and runs variable-length attention confined by `cu_seqlens`; pipelines that already collate without padding can call `packed_forward()` directly and skip the pad/unpad boundary entirely.
3. **Dispatch and graphs** — a per-GPU calibrated policy picks between a specialized packed Triton attention kernel and FlashAttention per batch, and optional bucketed CUDA graphs collapse the kernel-launch floor for short-sequence workloads.

## Installation

Install the base runtime with CUDA 12.8:

```bash
uv pip install --torch-backend cu128 packed-encoders
```

From source, the lockfile selects Torch 2.11 / Triton 3.6 / CUDA 12.8:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:pau-mensa/packed-encoders.git
cd packed-encoders
uv sync --locked --no-dev                                # base runtime
uv sync --locked --no-dev --extra fa2                     # compiled FA2, including RTX 5090
uv sync --locked --no-dev --extra fa2 --extra pylate       # PyLate / ModernColBERT
uv sync --locked --no-dev --extra qwen3_5 --extra fa2      # topk-embed-v1, complete environment
uv sync --locked --no-dev --extra fa4                     # CuteDSL FA4 on sm_90 / sm_100
```

FA2 wheels come from [Astral's GPU index](https://wheels.astral.sh/), with explicit
Torch ABI dependencies. The locked 2.11 wheels cover Linux x86-64/aarch64 and
CPython 3.10–3.14, replacing the old Python-3.11-only GitHub wheel. Only FA2 is
sourced from this index. For an existing environment or a published package,
`uv pip` needs the index explicitly for published packages (project source settings
are not wheel metadata):

```bash
uv pip install --no-sources --torch-backend cu128 \
  --index https://wheels.astral.sh/simple/cu128/ \
  "packed-encoders[fa2,qwen3_5]"
# Use -e ".[fa2,qwen3_5]" instead of the package name for an editable checkout.
```

- The **package requires Torch 2.11 and Triton 3.6** on Python 3.10–3.14.
  Users retaining Torch 2.8 should pin `packed-encoders==0.1.0`.
- The **`qwen3_5` extra selects Torch 2.11**, Transformers 5.9, FLA, the
  SentenceTransformers multi-vector wrapper and matching torchvision. It needs
  no `--no-deps` workaround and can be combined with `fa2` or `fa4`.
- **PyLate and `qwen3_5` need separate environments**: PyLate currently pins
  SentenceTransformers 5.3, while topk uses 6.x. Request the extras individually;
  `--all-extras` is intentionally invalid. The `sentence-transformers` extra can
  be combined with either.
- FlashAttention is optional: the packed Triton kernel ships in-tree and SDPA
  needs no extra dependency. On large token budgets FA is heavily recommended.
  The FA4 GPU paths still require validation on their target hardware; the local
  5090 correctness suite validates the compiled FA2 path.
- Add `--group test` for pytest or omit `--no-dev` for benchmark/development
  dependencies. GPU tests require model downloads on their first run. For CPU CI,
  use `uv pip install --no-sources --torch-backend cpu -e . pytest`.

For the tested environments and remaining performance checks, see
[the Torch installation review](docs/torch-2.11-review.md).

### Requirements

- An NVIDIA GPU of compute capability sm_80, sm_89, sm_90, sm_100, or sm_120, with a working `ptxas` (CuteDSL JIT-compiles at runtime).
- bf16 weights for inference, or fp32 master weights under bf16 autocast for training.

## ⚡️ Quick Start

```python
import packed_encoders as pe
from transformers import AutoModel

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("answerdotai/ModernBERT-base", dtype="bfloat16").cuda()
pe.pack(model)                      # validated fused forward, installed in place
out = model(input_ids=ids, attention_mask=mask).last_hidden_state
```

`pack()` locates the encoder inside whatever you hand it — a raw HF model, a `SentenceTransformer`, or a PyLate `ColBERT`:

```diff
  from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
  st = SentenceTransformer("answerdotai/ModernBERT-base").cuda().bfloat16()
+ pe.pack(st)
  emb = st.encode(texts)
```

```diff
  from pylate import models
  colbert = models.ColBERT(model_name_or_path="lightonai/GTE-ModernColBERT-v1")
+ pe.pack(colbert)
  train_loss = losses.CachedContrastive(model=colbert, ...)
```

## Usage

### Attention backends

```python
pe.pack(model, attention_backend="auto")   # default when an optimized kernel is importable
```

| Backend | What it is |
|---|---|
| `"auto"` | Calibrated per-batch choice between the packed Triton kernel and FlashAttention. Exact-card policies exist for RTX 5090, A100-SXM4-40GB, L40S, H200, and B200; uncalibrated cards conservatively prefer Flash. |
| `"triton"` | The in-tree packed short-attention kernel — no-grad bf16 ModernBERT-base geometry (12 × 64 heads), global or local-64 attention, `Smax ≤ 128`. Invariant misses prefer Flash, then SDPA. |
| `"flash"` | FlashAttention with sliding-window pruning; varlen kernel on padded batches. FA2 wheel on sm_120, CuteDSL FA4 on sm_90/sm_100. Raises if no kernel is present. |
| `"sdpa"` | Dependency-free dense-mask attention. The explicit safe choice and the final fallback. |

The dispatch policy uses only host-visible shapes (never device values, so it stays CUDA-graph-capturable) and was fit per card against measured crossovers: on the RTX 5090 the Triton kernel wins below **20,736 live tokens** and FA2 above; at the kernel level the specialized Triton kernel is **1.4–2.1x** faster than FA2 in its envelope. Policies are exact-card and backend-version specific by design — see the [`benchmarks/` guide](benchmarks/README.md) for the formulas, sweeps, parity numbers, and reproduction commands.

### CUDA graphs

The package also offers the possibility of using CUDA graphs for short-sequence inference, which is usually host-launch-bound; the bucketed graph runner collapses the whole forward to a single replay:

```python
# Rectangular graphs over padded (B, S) buckets:
pe.pack(model, cuda_graph=True, attention_backend="sdpa")

# Packed graphs (auto/triton/flash) need explicit batch and sequence bounds:
pe.pack(model, cuda_graph=pe.GraphConfig(
    pad_to=64, max_batch=256, max_seq=128, max_graphs=32,
))

with pe.no_cuda_graph(model):          # bypass for a one-off odd shape
    out = model(input_ids=huge_ids, attention_mask=huge_mask)
pe.set_cuda_graph(model, False)        # or flip after the fact
```

- Graphs engage only when gradients and CUDA autocast are both disabled; out-of-bucket shapes fall back to the eager fused forward automatically.
- `cuda_graph=True` only captures calls with `S ≤ 64` (`cuda_graph_seq_cutoff`), which keeps graphs only on short S regimes.
- The attention backend is resolved before capture and baked into each graph, so replay does zero dispatch work.
- Kill switch: `PACKED_ENCODERS_GRAPH=0` disables all graph runners globally.

Training has its own captured forward+backward runner:

```python
pe.pack(model, train_cuda_graph=pe.TrainGraphConfig(max_seq=64))
```

with two caller invariants: `optimizer.zero_grad(set_to_none=False)` (the backward graph writes into persistent `.grad`) and fixed `(B, S)` shapes per captured step.

> [!TIP]
> CUDA Graphs for training only help if the training regime is very short `S` bounded, both for documents and queries, for instance if the query length is 32 and the document length is 128.

### Check if your encoder is supported with `validate()`

`pack()` runs `validate()` by default (`validate=False` to skip). It checks:

1. the model architecture (`config.model_type`, and with it the split-half RoPE convention the kernels assume);
2. the compute capability against the validated matrix: sm_80, sm_89, sm_90, sm_100, sm_120;
3. that the CuteDSL toolchain can JIT a kernel on this machine;
4. that the fused forward tracks stock HF within the bf16 band (cosine ≥ 0.997 at S = 128/512/2048).

The packed forward requires `input_ids`; `inputs_embeds`, attention/hidden-state outputs, and non-zero `token_type_ids` are not supported.

### Fully packed execution (advanced)

`pack()` keeps the public padded interface. If your pipeline already collates without padding, `packed_forward()` is the direct entry:

```python
import torch
from packed_encoders.config import ModernBertParams
from packed_encoders.forward import packed_forward

params = ModernBertParams.from_hf_config(model.config)
# three sequences of lengths 5, 3, 8 — concatenated, zero pad tokens
packed_ids   = torch.cat([ids_a, ids_b, ids_c])                             # [16]
cu_seqlens   = torch.tensor([0, 5, 8, 16], dtype=torch.int32, device="cuda")
position_ids = torch.cat([torch.arange(n) for n in (5, 3, 8)]).cuda()       # [16]

hidden = packed_forward(model, params, packed_ids, cu_seqlens, 8, position_ids)  # [16, H]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to use it for training you'll also have to use a custom packed loss as well.

&nbsp;

## Benchmarks

All numbers come from real `Tevatron/AgentIR-data` queries and long documents, are PyTorch-vs-PyTorch comparisons, and report peak **reserved** VRAM. Every accelerated path is parity-checked against eager stock before a result is published (cosine ≥ 0.999 on these runs). Configs, runners, protocols, and remote launchers live in [`benchmarks/`](benchmarks/README.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These benchmarks were done on a 5090 and a B200 and are just the headline. You should measure your own use case and pick the config that works best for you.

### Inference (RTX 5090, batch 8)

Queries are capped at 128 tokens (dispatch-bound; CUDA graphs enabled on the packed paths), documents at 2048 (compute-bound; graphs deliberately off). Sequences/second, higher is better:

| Endpoint | Model family | Eager HF | `torch.compile` | `pe.pack` | Fully packed |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Queries (≤128) | ColBERT (PyLate) | 1,370 | 2,614 | 3,149 | **3,572 (+160%)** |
| Queries (≤128) | single-vector (ST) | 1,441 | 2,833 | 3,507 | **3,602 (+150%)** |
| Documents (≤2048) | ColBERT (PyLate) | 207 | 281 | 379 | **388 (+87%)** |
| Documents (≤2048) | single-vector (ST) | 232 | 329 | 473 | **480 (+106%)** |

On documents the packed path is faster *and* leaner than eager (0.80-0.85 vs 0.82-1.04 GB reserved). On queries the graphed packed path deliberately trades memory for throughput (~1.2-1.4 GB reserved vs ~0.4-0.5 eager).

### Indexing (RTX 5090, batch 128, documents ≤2048)

| Model family | Eager HF | `torch.compile` | `pe.pack` | Fully packed | Peak reserved |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| ColBERT (PyLate) | 143 docs/s | 199 | 387 | **418 (2.9x)** | 7.85 → 5.80 GB (−26%) |
| single-vector (ST) | 160 docs/s | 243 | 522 | **527 (3.3x)** | 7.87 → 5.75 GB (−27%) |

The fully packed late-interaction index is also **2.15x smaller** on disk (60 MB vs 129 MB for the same corpus) because no rectangular token tensor or mask is stored.

![B200 single-vector training memory](benchmarks/docs/assets/training_b200_single_vector_memory.png)

All variants start from a bit-identical initial probe loss and follow comparable optimization trajectories under the same data and training configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> The B200 showcase was measured with PyTorch 2.11, which is now also selected by the repository lock. The historical measurements have not been rerun for this installation change. See the training protocol for the complete benchmark environment.

### Reproducibility

The runners and canonical configs are checked in; the figures above are snapshots from the published reference runs. See the protocols for [inference](benchmarks/docs/inference.md), [indexing](benchmarks/docs/indexing.md), and [training](benchmarks/docs/training.md) for the exact environment, methodology, and parity gates. Attention crossover calibration is documented in the same [`benchmarks/` guide](benchmarks/README.md).

## Tests

```bash
uv run pytest tests/
```

The suite covers kernel numerics (LayerNorm, matmul, short attention — tile boundaries, raggedness, cross-sequence isolation, determinism), backend selection and dispatch-score logic, CUDA-graph bucketing for inference and training, and padded/packed forward-backward parity against stock Hugging Face.
